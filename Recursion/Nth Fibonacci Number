Nth Fibonacci Number
Given a positive integer n, find the nth fibonacci number. Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 1000000007.

Note: for the reference of this question take first fibonacci number to be 1.

Examples :

Input: n = 2
Output: 1 
Explanation: 1 is the 2nd number of fibonacci series.
Input: n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the 5th number of fibonacci series.

class Solution {
    
    private static final int mod=1000000007;
    static int nthFibonacci(int n){
      if(n==1 || n==2) return 1;
      return (nthFibonacci(n-1)+nthFibonacci(n-2))%mod;
    }
}
