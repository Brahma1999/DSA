Count Linked List Nodes

Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :
Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.
Input: LinkedList : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

CODE:

class Solution {
    // Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public int getCount(Node head) {
        
        if(head==null) return 0;
        if(head.next==null) return 1;
        
        Node temp=head;
        int count=0;
        while(temp!=null)
        {
            count++;
            temp=temp.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
