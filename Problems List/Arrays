•Check if an array is sorted in ascending order.
•Find the second largest element in an array.
•Count the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array.
•Find the largest contiguous subarray sum (Kadane's Algorithm).
•Rotate an array to the right by k positions.
•Find the index of the first occurrence of a given element.
•Remove duplicates from a sorted array.

Medium Level

•Find the intersection of two arrays.
•Move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

•Find the common elements in three sorted arrays.
•Find the maximum product of two integers in an array.
•Find the contiguous subarray with the maximum product.
•Find the pair with the smallest difference in a sorted array.
