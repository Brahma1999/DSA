Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Code:
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {

        int n=t.length();
        
        int spoint=0;
        int tpoint=0;
        while(tpoint < n){
            //If characters match ,move the s pointer
            if(spoint <s.length() && s.charAt(spoint)==t.charAt(tpoint)){
                spoint++;
            }
            //Always move the pointer at t
            tpoint++;
        }
        return spoint ==s.length();
    }
}
